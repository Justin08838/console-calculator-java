# Console-Based Java Calculator

## Description
A **simple console-based calculator** written in Java.  
It performs **basic arithmetic operations**: addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).  

This project demonstrates **input handling, conditional logic, and basic arithmetic** — perfect for beginners learning Java.

## Features
- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division  
- Handles **division by zero** gracefully  
- Accepts user input via console  
- Displays clear output messages  

---

## Technologies Used
- Java  
- Scanner class for user input

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Java installed** on your system.  
2. Clone or download this repository.  
3. Open terminal/command prompt in the project directory.  
4. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   javac Main.java

5. Run the program

  java Main

6.Follow the on-screen prompts to perform calculations.

Enter the first number: 12
Enter the operation like +,-,*,/: *
Enter the second number: 4
The output is: 48

What I Learned
Taking user input using Scanner
Handling characters and numbers
Implementing conditional logic using if-else
Basic error handling (division by zero)


Future Improvements
Support for decimal numbers
Add a loop for multiple calculations
Use switch-case for cleaner code
Add advanced mathematical operations
